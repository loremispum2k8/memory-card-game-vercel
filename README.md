# **How to Play**:

1. Click a card you haven’t clicked yet → your current score increases.

2. Click a card you already clicked → you lose, and your current score resets, but your best score stays saved.

3. After every click, the cards shuffle, making it trickier to remember their positions.

- Built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game fetches dog images from an API, so each round features fresh, cute dogs. It also saves progress using Local Storage.
